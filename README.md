# ShaderProject_TaskTemplate

Bonjour, mis amis!
The Unity Shaders project offered in Winter by the Game Development Club will provide you with knowledge on how to create your own shaders and materials using the Unity Shader Graph. We will also take a look at Post Processing and Lighting.
Find below the task details that need to be submitted if you want to take this project.

Task
Fork/Clone this repo.
In the project, you will find a DemoScene with a car and a ground where the materials of both the car and the ground have been altered to make them not feel visually pleasing. It should look something like this.

![Task](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1c6bb2e-9e22-4022-8e18-0e51e7a57ea1)

Your task is to create/edit materials for the Car and Ground. Sky is the limit here so get as creative and make it look as good as you can. Do make sure to make the windows of the car transparent.
Once the materials are done, you also need to implement post processing, specifically Bloom for the head and tail lights of the car.

Final deliverable is :
Either a pull request on the task repo or a github link of your own with all the materials and post processing done.
